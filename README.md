This list of words is a follow-up and extension of the Shutterstock [List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words](https://github.com/LDNOOBW/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words/tree/master) as that list is not maintained anymore. As there are many profanity word lists around in the web (and many not maintained) there content was crabbed and joint here together (see the source list below). 
As the opinion which words should be in such lists varies between culture, language, and geographies, feel free to extend them to your needs.
#### Structure and Format
The files are named by the isocode of the country and are **utf-8** encoded, having one expression per line. All words contained in the Englisch "*en*" file are excluded in the other language files. For often used words were the classification as a profane word is doubtful there is a csv-file "*questionable_international_words.csv*" (separator is the comma "**,**") with 152 words for several languages. The header line contains the iso-code of the language, a classification column and remark column. These words are **NOT** included in the language-files.
